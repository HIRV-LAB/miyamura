Software faults in spacecraft (e.g., artificial satellite and rockets) software leads to mission failures. 
To identify software faults, I focus on the incomplete software requirement, which is a major reason causing software faults.
Based on the two perspectives of software fault and development software process,  present a classification method for software faults which are extracted from actual spacecraft project . 
For classifying defects, I apply classification based on the eight perspectives proposed by Avizienis.
In addition, the perspective of development software process is based on the development standard provided by JAXA.
I expect that this approach can help to identify the tendency of faults and reveal which certain kind of process leads to more faults.
By applying the proposed classification method in JAXA project, I discover the process which is the source of faults. 
Based on this finding, I consider that the method could be utilized for new project in the future.
