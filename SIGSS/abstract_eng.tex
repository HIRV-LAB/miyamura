Software faults in spacecraft software can largely obstruct the chance of missions success.
In this research, we focus on the incomplete software requirement which is considered to be a major cause of software faults.
Based on two perspectives of fault classification and standard development process, classified software faults that we retrieved from actual spacecraft project(e.g., artificial satellite and rockets).
By carrying out this classification, it becomes clear which kind of process leads to more faults.
