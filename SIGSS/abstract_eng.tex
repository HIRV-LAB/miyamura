Software faults in spacecraft software leads to mission failures. To identify software faults, we focus on the incomplete software requirement, on reprehensive reason for the software faults. Based on two perspectives of software fault and development software process, we present a classification method for software faults which are extracted from actual spacecraft project (e.g., artificial satellite and rockets). We expect that this approach can help to identify the tendency of faults and reveal which certain kind of process leads to more faults.
