Software faults in spacecraft software can largely hinder the success chance of missions.
In this research, we focus on the omitted requirement which is considered to be a major cause of software faults.
From the two perspectives of fault classification and standard development process, we classified software faults that we retrieved from actual spacecraft project.
By carrying out this classification, it becomes clear which kind of process leads to more faults.
